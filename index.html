        <h2>Jada-Marie Dotting</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jada-Marie Dotting and I am a sophomore at the University of the West Indies, Mona, where I am currently studying Computer Science. During my first year, I was able to develop my skills in two new programming languages&mdash;python and java, and I also worked on a few projects, both individual and collaborative. Outside of computing, I am very passionate about all things Art & Design, and so, a goal of mine is to pursue a career that combines both worlds, for example Web Design/Development. When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, I enjoy dancing and learning languages in my free time.</p>
