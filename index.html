        <h2>Jada-Marie Dotting</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jada-Marie Dotting and I am a sophomore at the University of the West Indies, Mona, where I am currently studying Computer Science. During my first year,  I was able to develop my skills in two new programming languages–python and java, and I also worked on a few projects, both individual and collaborative. Outside of computing, I'm very passionate about all things Art & Design and so a goal of mine to pursue a career combines both worlds, for example UI/UX design. When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy dancing and learning languages in my free time.
